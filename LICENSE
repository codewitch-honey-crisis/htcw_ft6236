This library was derived from Adafruit's FT6236 library

This is a library for the FT6236 touchscreen controller by FocalTech.
The FT6236 and FT6236u work the same way.
A lot of this library is originally written by Limor Fried/Ladyada.
Because Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing
products from Adafruit!
